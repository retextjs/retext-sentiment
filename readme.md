# retext-sentiment

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use a different way to detect sentiment, such as
with [`words/polarity`][polarity].

Legacy [documentation for this package](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-sentiment/tree/5cbb516)
is still available in Git.
